# Quasi-continuous short-cut adsorption chiller process simulator
You can calculate the performance of the adsorption chiller(COP, cooling power) with good accuracy and high computational efficiency.  
An instraction is given in 'manual.md'


# Requirement
* Python 3.8.5
* REFPROP
* TILMedia for Modelica (to calculate dynamic simulation in DYMOLA)
